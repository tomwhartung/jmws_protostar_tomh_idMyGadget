## About IdMyGadget:

**This repo is built on the _IdMyGadget Device Detection Adapter API_ &copy;.**

### For Details:
For details about IdMyGadget&copy;, see the README.md file:
* https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget/blob/master/README.md

Like all of the code in this repository, IdMyGadget&copy; is open source.
Therefore you can feel free to download IdMyGadget&copy;, install the device detectors, run the demos, and use it to build your own projects.

### To See IdMyGadget in Action:
To see IdMyGadget&copy; in action (without Joomla!), see my resume:
* http://tomwhartung.com/resume

Note that this is not responsive design, so you cannot simply shrink the window to see how the page looks on a mobile device.

In other words, **to see the power of device detection,** in this case, when coupled with jQuery Mobile, **be sure to visit the site using both a mobile phone and a desktop PC!**

Note that the source for my resume is in github here:

My resume is also open source, so feel free to download it, add your own details (in json, following the examples in the js/*-examples.js files), and make your own mobile-friendly resume!

### About IdMyGadget for Joomla!
