# jmws_tomh_idMyGadget
I am using this repo to integrate the default joomla template protostar with idMyGadget (like jmws_protostar_idMyGadget), and also add some additional changes that I just "feel" like doing.

## Status:
This is a work in progress (WIP), so anything but minimal documentation would be premature at this time.

## References:
For details about idMyGadget, see the idMyGadget README.md file:
* https://github.com/tomwhartung/idMyGadget/blob/master/README.md

Feel free to download idMyGadget, install the device detectors, and run the demos.

To see idMyGadget in action, see my resume:
* http://tomwhartung.com/resume

To see the power of device detection, when coupled with jQuery Mobile, be sure to visit the site using both a mobile phone and a desktop PC.

Feel free to download my resume, add your own details (in json, following the examples in the js/*-examples.js files, and make your own mobile-friendly resume!
